Hybrid geoid created by fitting a high-resolution gravimetric geoid model for Japan, “JGEOID2008” to GNSS/leveling geoid undulations at 971 sites by the Least-Squares Collocation method. The standard deviation of the model at the GNSS/leveling sites is 1.8 cm. The geoid height shown in this model is the height over the GRS80-compliant ellipsoid using latitude and longitude values in the Japan Geodetic System 2011 frame.

This grid file is a crop of the original bounding box to a the minimal pixel area that covers the area of use of EPSG:6695: Japan - onshore mainland (EPSG:3263 . The data for the Tokara, Amami, Okinawa, and Sakishima Islands in the Ryukyu Archipelago, the Daitö Islands and the Ogasawara Islands has been discarded due to the lack of a vertical coordinate reference system in the EPSG catalog.
