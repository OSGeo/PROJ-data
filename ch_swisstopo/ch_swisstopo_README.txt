Recommended to transform from Swiss reference frame LV03 (system CH1903, EPSG:21781) to Swiss reference frame LV95 (system CH1903+, EPSG:2056).
LV95 is aligned to ETRF93, but shifted by several 100 meters.
CH1903+ is the official reference system for federal surveying and for all national geobasis data regulated by federal law since 2017.
CHENyx06a.gsb gives corrections (distorsions between LV03 and LV95) in CH1903, CHENyx06_ETRS.gsb gives the corrections in ETRS.
Several transformation services are available on https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/maps-data-online/calculation-services.html
(web forms and REST web geoservices) to support the exact transformation procedure between CH1903 and CH1903+
using the REFRAME algorithm (finite element transformation).
The difference between the grid and finite element transformation is on a level of below several millimeters.
